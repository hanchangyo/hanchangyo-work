abstract: Nowadays, there have been many research works on multiple-intermediate-frequency-over-fiber
  (multi-IFoF)-based mobile fronthaul link to accommodate explosive mobile data traffic.
  The performance of multi-IFoF transmission scheme is affected by fiber dispersion-induced
  second-order distortion in 1.5 $Î¼$m. Thus, we derive an appropriate frequency plan
  to avoid the distortion. By utilizing the frequency plan, we successfully transmit
  24- 20-MHz long-term evolution advanced (LTE-A) signals over 60-km single-mode fiber
  (SMF) without any penalties from the distortion. We also show the transmission performance
  when transmitting larger number of IF carriers in the limited modulation bandwidth
  so the penalties from the distortion are inevitable. We confirm that 72- 20-MHz
  LTE-A carriers can be transmitted over 30-km SMF within only 1.5-GHz modulation
  bandwidth.
