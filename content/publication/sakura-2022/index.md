abstract: Although the interaction capability of soft sensors has been explored in
  the field of HCI, they are found to have limitations in shape, wiring management,
  and softness due to the characteristics of the material. In this paper, we propose
  a design of 3D-printed resistive soft sensors that can detect deformation by creating
  internal lattice structures with flexible conductive materials. The magnitude of
  deformation can be detected by measuring the resistance between a pair of electrodes.
  By adjusting the parameters of the lattice structure, a soft sensor with high flexibility
  of shape design and adjustable local softness can be realized. In addition, by inserting
  non-conductive structures into the sensor structure, external wires can be consolidated
  in one place. We present a design and fabrication pipeline, and investigate the
  fundamental characteristics of several patterns of sensors. We also show several
  applications that demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method.
