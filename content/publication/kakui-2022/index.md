abstract: Invisible screen-camera communication is promising in that it does not interfere
  with the video viewing experience. In the imperceptible color vibration method,
  which displays two colors of the same luminance alternately at high speed for each
  pixel, embedded information is decoded by taking the difference between distant
  frames on the time axis. Therefore, the interframe differences of the original video
  contents affect the decoding performance. In this study, we propose a decoding method
  which utilizes simultaneously captured images using a dual-camera smartphone with
  different exposure times. This allows taking the color difference between the frames
  that are close to each other on the time axis. The feasibility of this approach
  is demonstrated through several application examples.
