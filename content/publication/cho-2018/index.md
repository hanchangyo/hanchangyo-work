abstract: 'An apparatus for transmitting a control signal in a radio-over-fiber (RoF)-based
  mobile fronthaul includes: a data channel transmitter configured to generate a data
  signal at a preassigned frequency or wavelength; a control channel transmitter configured
  to generate a control signal at a designated frequency or wavelength that is shared
  with other apparatuses; and a combiner configured to combine the data signal with
  the control signal.'
