abstract: We propose a novel method of fiber-nonlinearity mitigation for ultra-long
  optical transmission systems, which employs two polarization modes mutually phase-conjugated.
  Simulations and experiments show that in the nonlinear region, this diversity method
  significantly outperforms both of the singleand dual-polarization schemes at the
  same bit rate.
